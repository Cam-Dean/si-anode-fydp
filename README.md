# si-anode-fydp

This repository contains source code with functions that can be used for cell data manipulation, and MATLAB live scripts used for data analysis. This code relates to a fourth-year design project (FYDP) at the University of Waterloo devoted to designing an enhanced high-capacity silicon anode, with reduced capacity fade.  

Two tasks are required within the scope of this project:  
1) Perform design verification to ensure that the Si-anode design will meet customer requirements for lifetime, power, and voltage  
2) Analyze cycling data to extract coulombic efficiency, capacity, DCR, and power output for Si-anode cells with various designs

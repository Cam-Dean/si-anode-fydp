# si-anode-fydp

This project will be used for two purposes:  
1) Perform design verification to ensure that the Si-anode design will meet customer requirements for lifetime and/or power  
2) Analyze cycling data to extract coulombic efficiency, capacity, DCR, and power output for Si-anode cells with various designs
